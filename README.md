This was a solo project that I have done in my 2nd project of ELAM in year 12. I programmed, 3d modelled and created UI for this game. I used C sharp, blender and photoshop to create this game. 

An exploration 3D platformer, you are looking to find a home for your planet, you stumble upon this unknown planet which is habitable for civilization however when you explore the planet you find something unsettlingâ€¦  FE meets Slenderman, will you find out what happened to this planet?
